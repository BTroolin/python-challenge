# pybank and pypoll python scripts.
Python scripts to analyze csv datasets
pybank analyzes profit/loss data over time to create a summary text file output.
pypoll tallies election results among candidates to create a candidate list and determine vote totals. Both scripts should be run with the same file structure as this project has; otherwise scripts will need to be edited to the correct file structure.
